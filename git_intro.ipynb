    "Allows us to separate our work from the main project. Essentially this makes a new state of the current code which won't affect the main state. One can create as many branches as they'd like and even branch off of branches. Each repo can have one or more branches. The main branch is called ```main```. This is usually the working version and contains production code. Branches should have descriptive names... teams decide on naming conventions. e.g. \"will_feature_dashboard_notifications\" includes information about the author, branch type, and description. Others may include ticket numbers as well.\n",

    "Don't comment on *what* should be changed, but *why* it should be changed. Be as clear as possible and make sure to be clear ast ot what to modify. Monitor for scalability and extensibility. Once all feedback is added, collaborators can click \"submit review\" which leads to the pull request being merged into ```main```.\n",
